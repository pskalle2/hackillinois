Python program that recommends computer classes based on user input. This program uses a dictionary to map user preferences to recommended classes. You can customize and expand the dictionary based on the specific classes you want to recommend.

You can run this program and enter your preferences (e.g., "programming, web development") when prompted. The program will then provide a list of recommended classes based on the user's input.
